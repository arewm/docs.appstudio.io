= Releasing an application

Two teams work together to release an application:

* *Development team* - The team that develops and supports the application in a pre-production environment.

* *Managed environment team* - The team that supports the production instance of that application.

[1] When an application is ready for release, the Development team contacts the Managed Environment team; for example, their organization's SRE team, requesting access to the Managed environment for the first production release.

[2] The Managed environment team creates the managed environment and responds to the development team with the managed environment's configuration details. The Managed environment inherits some details of the development teamâ€™s workspace. However, the development team has limited access to the production environment, which is a part of the managed environment.

[3] The development team creates a matching configuration in their environment that is same as that of the Managed environment and attempts to release the application to production.

[4] The Managed environment team validates the initial release and configures a traffic gateway, which allows external traffic to the application.
