= Enabling a Snyk task

[abstract]
The `sast-snyk-check` task uses the Snyk Code tool to perform static application security testing (SAST). 
Specifically, the Snyk check scans an application's source code for potential security vulnerabilities, 
including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and code injection attack vulnerabilities.

> NOTE: You can run a Snyk task only if you have a Snyk token stored in a namespace secret. 
You should also include the name of your secret in the *snyk-secret* pipeline parameter.

== Enabling a Snyk task

. Register for a Snyk account or log in at https://app.snyk.io/.
. Get a Snyk token.
.. In the lower left of the home page, click your name, then select *Account settings*.
.. From the Account Settings page, select *General*, which is the default, then *Auth Token*.

... Paste your Snyk token into the *Upload the file with value for your key or paste its contents* field.
... Click *Add secret* to save it.
. Update your `.tekton` YAML files to specify your Snyk secret.
.. From your GitHub repository, update the `pull-request.yaml` files in your `.tekton` directory; for example: link:https://github.com/sonam1412/devfile-sample-python-basic/blob/main/.tekton/devfile-sample-python-basic-iea1-pull-request.yaml[devfile-sample-python-basic/.tekton/devfile-sample-python-basic-rhq8-pull-request.yaml]
.. Add new lines to the code in your YAML files to include *snyk-secret*, as shown in the following example:
